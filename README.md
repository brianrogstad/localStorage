# Local Storage Example
App built using jQuery and Local Storage.

When there is nothing in local storage the app creates four entries with the init function.
from there you can add more data to the local storage using the form.

Refresh or close the window and revisit to see that the data stays.
If a value is added that already exists, the value gets added and the table is resorted.
